## Project Title and Description

Pax Digital Insurance Journey

This project is our submission for a hackathon, aimed at simplifying the insurance purchasing process, which currently involves multiple steps and can be time-consuming and daunting for clients. By implementing innovative digital solutions, we aim to make this process more efficient and user-friendly.

Our app features a form for inputting user data, making the process fast and efficient for the end user. The interface appears naturally as a chat, providing a more engaging experience. Additionally, we have implemented complete back-office support for accepting new applicants, all handled automatically to reduce costs and make the process more affordable.

## Our Product

### Onboarding Process

The challenge we aimed to solve was to make the insurance onboarding process more efficient, faster, and easier as a whole. 
We wanted the end user to be the main focus of our project, ensuring a seamless experience without unnecessary complexities like chatbots or AI-generated voices. 
In fact, statistics show that having a chatbot for insurance can negatively impact the customer experience, which led us to opt for our current solution â€“ combining the best of both worlds.

Our solution features a fast and efficient form for data input, presented in a chat-like interface that provides a natural and engaging user experience.

### Back-Office

Not all applicants are automatically accepted into the insurance pool, as there are risks (e.g., medical conditions, smoking) that need further assessment. 
We addressed this by implementing an automatic back-office process, allowing employees to review and approve applications more efficiently.

There are certain cases that need to be considered during the back-office review:

1. **Green**: The application passes all checks automatically, and no further action is needed.
2. **Orange**: Additional information is required. The employee will see what needs to be requested and can send an automatic request via email. 
              In some cases, the insurance sum may be too high, and our algorithm proposes an alternative contract that fulfills all requirements, often by reducing the insured amount.
3. **Red**: The applicant is not accepted. However, their data is saved in our database. 

Data is saved because the situation can change over time, such as every month, allowing the weights of our algorithm to be adjusted with a visual graph that shows these weights. 
Red candidates are automatically reconsidered if they become eligible at a later point.

## Setup and Installation Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Start PostgreSQL Server as Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=johndoe -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=randompassword -e POSTGRES_DB=mydb -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
   ```

2. **Create `.env` File**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following content:
   ```env
   POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
   POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
   POSTGRES_URL_NO_SSL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb"
   POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb"
   POSTGRES_USER="johndoe"
   POSTGRES_HOST="localhost"
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD="randompassword"
   POSTGRES_DATABASE="mydb"
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Generate Prisma Client**:
   ```bash
   turbo db:generate
   ```

5. **Push Prisma Schema to Database**:
   ```bash
   turbo db:push
   ```

6. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   turbo dev
   ```

## Architecture and Technical Overview

This project is built using a modern, scalable, and type-safe architecture. The following is a technical overview of the architecture and main components:

- **Monorepo Structure**: Managed using Turborepo, with separate applications for the onboarding process (`journey`) and back-office (`admin`) to ensure modularity and scalability.
- **Full-Stack Framework**: Next.js 14 is used for both frontend and backend, enabling server-side rendering, static generation, and API route handling in a unified codebase.
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL is used as the database, with Prisma as the ORM for efficient data modeling, type safety, and easy integration with the Next.js backend.
- **State Management**: React Hooks are used along with Zustand-based custom stores for efficient state handling across the application. URL state management is done with nuqs.
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI, based on Radix UI primitives, is used for building accessible and reusable components. Framer Motion and TypeWriter Effect are used to enhance the user experience with animations.
- **Shared Libraries**: Shared UI components (`@repo/ui`) and database logic (`@repo/database`) are maintained as packages to promote code reuse and consistency across different parts of the application.

## Challenges and Future Improvements
- We made authentication and user amanagement for the backoffice with clerk. This is because we have senesitive information. So we need this protection layer. This needed an action auth and a QueryClientProvier for react. This was hard to inject and needed a lot of word.
- For our chat and location feature, we used query parameter in the url. To make this less error prone, we used type safe query parameters in react. This was complicated, but refreshing to implement.
- We have a lot of data stored into the local storage, so the user can alwyas scroll back, scroll forward etc. The userID especially is saved in the session.
- The chat feature was hard to implement beacuse we neede the animation, preserving states for components when sliding up. This needed to feel natural.
